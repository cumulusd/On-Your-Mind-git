On-Your-Mind-git
================

This is the source code for my app "On Your Mind" available on the AppStore.

The app is fairly simple. Core data is used to maintain the notes and Local Notifications power the reminders.

My goal as stated in the app store description was to create a place to save a thought (and be reminded about it) with the
intention that it would be organized into another app later. I used Evernote, have a couple of different task managers
that I use, and other productivity apps, so I definietly had the problem of "where should this thought be placed?".
